# Rice-crop-prediction

### Description:
This project addresses the global issue of hunger by leveraging machine learning and satellite data to identify regions where rice is cultivated and forecast crop yields. With rice serving as a staple food for over half of the world's population, understanding its cultivation patterns and predicting yield variations due to factors like climate change are crucial for food security efforts.

### Key Features:
Crop Identification: Utilize machine learning models to analyze satellite imagery and accurately identify areas where rice is cultivated.
Crop Forecasting: Forecast rice crop yields in identified areas using climate and satellite data, providing insights into the impact of climate change on agricultural productivity.

### Data Sources:
Microsoft's Planetary Computer
Sentinel-1 (radar)
Sentinel-2 (optical)
Landsat (optical)

### Technologies Used:
Python
Machine Learning Libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, scikit-learn)
Data Processing Libraries (e.g., pandas, NumPy)
Satellite Image Processing Libraries (e.g., rasterio)
Git and GitHub for version control

### Target Audience:
Researchers and scientists interested in agricultural modeling and food security.
Developers looking to contribute to projects addressing global challenges.
Policy-makers and organizations involved in food security initiatives.

### Why It Matters:
By accurately identifying regions where rice is cultivated and forecasting crop yields, this project contributes to efforts aimed at mitigating hunger on a global scale. By understanding the dynamics of rice production and its response to changing environmental conditions, stakeholders can make informed decisions to ensure food security for vulnerable populations.
